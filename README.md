# Hangman-Game

Objective:
The objective of Hangman is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a hangman figure being drawn. The game is won if the word is guessed correctly before the hangman figure is fully drawn; it is lost if the figure is completed.

Setup:
1. **Word Selection:** One player (or the game system) chooses a word or phrase, which is kept hidden from the guessing player(s).
2. **Display:** The chosen word is represented by a series of blank spaces (underscores) corresponding to each letter in the word. For example, the word "apple" would be displayed as "_ _ _ _ _".

Gameplay:
1. Guessing Letters: The guessing player suggests letters one at a time.
2. Correct Guesses: If the guessed letter is in the word, all instances of that letter are revealed in their correct positions. For example, guessing 'p' for "apple" would change the display to "_ p p _ _".
3. **Incorrect Guesses: If the guessed letter is not in the word, it is considered incorrect, and a part of the hangman figure is drawn.
4. Tracking Guesses: Both correct and incorrect guesses are usually recorded for reference. Incorrect letters are often displayed separately so the player does not guess the same letter again.

Hangman Figure:
- The figure is typically drawn in stages, with each incorrect guess adding one part. The stages usually include:
  1. Base (ground)
  2. Vertical pole
  3. Horizontal beam
  4. Rope
  5. Head
  6. Body
  7. One arm
  8. Other arm
  9. One leg
  10. Other leg

Winning and Losing:
- Win: The guessing player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn.
- Lose: The guessing player loses if the hangman figure is completed before the word is fully guessed.

Example:
- Word: "banana"
- Initial Display: "_ _ _ _ _ _"
- Guesses: 'a' (correct, display: "_ a _ a _ a"), 'e' (incorrect), 'n' (correct, display: "_ a n a n a"), 'b' (correct, display: "b a n a n a").
- Win: The word is completely guessed before the hangman figure is fully drawn.
